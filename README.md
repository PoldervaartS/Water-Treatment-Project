# Water-Treatment-Project
Identifies pellets based on color and size, sorts them, then reads a barcode to deliver the appropriate amount of pellets.

Requires labview to run, based on the lego mindstorms robotics kit. Scans a barcode to specify the dosage requirements, then
organizes a random selection of colored and various sized pellets from a hopper input. Identifies the pellets based on color and size,
keeping track of inventory, and ultimately would dispense the correct dosage or sound an alarm if there were not enough pellets to 
dispense the full dosage.
